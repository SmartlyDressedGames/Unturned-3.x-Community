Hey, players! You can use this GitHub repository as a way of sending in bug reports and modding feature requests for the PC (Steam) version of _Unturned_.

Console players should send their bug reports through the dedicated "[Unturned: Console Bug Form](https://fs16.formsite.com/hook/unturned/index.html)" instead.

Anything else (such as ban appeals, gameplay suggestions, and site feedback) falls out of the scope of what this repository is intended for, and should instead be posted on our [official forums](https://forum.smartlydressedgames.com/).

For modding and server documentation, see: [U3 Docs](https://github.com/SmartlyDressedGames/U3-Docs).
