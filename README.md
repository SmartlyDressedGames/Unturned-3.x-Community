Hey, players! You can use this GitHub repository as a way of sending in bug reports and modding feature requests for the PC (Steam) version of _Unturned_.

Anything else (such as ban appeals, gameplay suggestions, and site feedback) falls out of the scope of what this repository is intended for. Console players can send their bug reports through the dedicated "[Unturned: Console Bug Form](https://fs16.formsite.com/hook/unturned/index.html)" instead.

For modding and server documentation, see: [U3 Docs](https://github.com/SmartlyDressedGames/U3-Docs).
