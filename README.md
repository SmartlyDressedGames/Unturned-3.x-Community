Hello, world!

This GitHub repository is geared towards technical users (like modders, plugin developers, and server hosts) of the PC (Steam) version of _Unturned_. You can use it to submit issue reports and get previews of upcoming changes. There are a lot of friendly members of the modding community who help out around here!

If you are looking for support please check out the [dedicated website](https://support.smartlydressedgames.com/hc/en-us).

Anything else (gameplay suggestions, modding feature requests, etc.) falls out of the scope of what this repository is intended for, and should instead be posted on our [official forums](https://forum.smartlydressedgames.com/).

For modding and server documentation please refer to: [U3 Docs](https://github.com/SmartlyDressedGames/U3-Docs).
